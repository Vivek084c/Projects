## Project Overview

I have integrated AWS Bedrock to develop a GenAI RAG-based application that processes user queries related to mutual fund data. The application leverages Amazon Titan LLM to parse queries, generates embeddings using an embedding model, and performs similarity searches in Pinecone to provide accurate responses.

## How It Works

1. **Query Parsing:**  
   The user query is parsed using Amazon Titan LLM.
   
2. **Embedding Generation:**  
   The output from the LLM is passed to an embedding generation model to create embeddings.
   
3. **Similarity Search:**  
   The generated embeddings are stored in the Pinecone vector database for performing similarity searches.

4. **Response Generation:**  
   Based on the search results, the LLM processes the output along with the original query, providing relevant responses to the user.

The system is designed to be scalable, future-proof, and highly efficient.

## Software Practices

- **Environment Management:**  
  Utilized a separate `.env` file for environment variables to ensure smooth configuration management.

- **Configuration Files:**  
  Maintained a dedicated config file for project settings to keep the configuration centralized and easily modifiable.

- **Clean and Scalable Pipeline:**  
  Ensured the code follows best practices for scalability and future-proofing, with a modular, maintainable pipeline for future enhancements.

- **Logging:**  
  Added logging to help users debug the application more effectively. This provides traceability and better error handling for users when running the app.

- **Deployment as Utility:**  
  With the environment variables and config files properly set up, the application can be easily deployed as a utility for various use cases.

## Future Integration

In the future, we can integrate **forecasting algorithms** to predict trends related to mutual fund data. Some potential forecasting algorithms include:

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):**  
   ARIMA can be used to forecast future values of mutual fund performance based on historical data. It combines autoregression and moving averages to predict future values, which could be beneficial for forecasting fund returns.

   *Integration Approach:* We can train the ARIMA model on historical fund return data, and use it to predict future percentage allocations and returns for specific mutual funds.

2. **Prophet (by Facebook):**  
   Prophet is a time-series forecasting algorithm that is robust to missing data and changes in trend. It can be useful for predicting long-term trends in mutual fund performance, including seasonality and holiday effects.

   *Integration Approach:* Prophet can be integrated by using historical monthly performance data to make future predictions about fund performance. The predictions could then be incorporated into the current system to enhance decision-making.

3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**  
   LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, is particularly effective for sequential data like time series. It can learn patterns in mutual fund performance over time and predict future trends.

   *Integration Approach:* An LSTM model could be trained on past mutual fund performance data and then used to predict future fund allocations and returns. The predictions can be fed into the existing pipeline to provide users with actionable insights.

These forecasting models will be integrated into the existing pipeline, allowing for more advanced analytics and predictions based on historical data.
